Here we are assuming that you have an conda environment file called env.yml named after walkwithfastai i.e.:\n# env.yml\nname: walkwithfastai\n\nchannels:\n  - fastai\n\ndependencies:\n  - fastai::nbdev&gt;=2.3.12\n# - python&gt;=3.11  # specify python version if required \n# - dependency 1\n# - dependency 2\n# - pip\n# pip:\n#   - pip dependency 1\n#   - pip dependency 2\nYou can then use conda or mamba (faster at resolving) to create and update your environment file should your needs change as you work on walkwithfastai\n# create a conda environment for working on walkwithfastai\n$ mamba env create -f env.yml\n\n# update conda environment\n$ mamba env update -n walkwithfastai --file env.yml\n\n\nInstall walkwithfastai in Development mode\n# activate conda environment\n$ conda activate walkwithfastai\n\n# make sure walkwithfastai package is installed in development mode\n$ pip install -e .\n\n# make changes under nbs/ directory\n# ...\n\n# compile to have changes apply to walkwithfastai\n$ nbdev_prepare",
